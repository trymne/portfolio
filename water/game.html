              <h2>The objective of the game</h2>
              <p>
                The objective of this game is to be the first player to get to
                square 64. On the way to the last square you will have to get
                past several obstacles. Can you get through the game without
                geting the corona virus? Or maybe you will secure yourself a
                vaccine and run right past.

              <h2>Setting up the game</h2>
              <p>
                In this game you will plas as someone living in either Africa,
                Asia or Europe. To fond out who you start as you have to throw 1
                dice. If you get 1-2, you are from Africa. If you get 3-4, you
                are from Asia. During the game players who get Africa are only
                allowed to use one die, players who get Asia can use 2 dice, and
                the players who get Europe can use all 3 dice. This rule aplies
                to all parts of the game. All players can now move their game
                piece to square 1.

              <h2>Rules of the game</h2>
              <p>
                The youngest player will start the round. To start their turn
                the player needs to throw the die/dice and move as many squares
                as the die/dice shows. If a player lands one a square with
                vaccine, the player needs to throw 8 or more in order to secure
                the vaccine. This means thats the players who got Africa can't
                get the vaccine. Any player who secured the vaccine can now land
                on the squares with the virus without falling down. Players
                without the vaccine who lands on the COVID squares has to move
                their game piece to the square pointed to by the arrow. First
                player to (or past) square 64 wins.
