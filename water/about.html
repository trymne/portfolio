          <h1>The process of making this website</h1>
          <p>
            I began this project by trying to think of a fun way that kids could
            learn about the importance of vaccines. For a long time I had big
            problems finding ideas that I was satisfied with, so I started
            working on the home page. I wanted to have short and concrete
            information about the substainable development goals, COVID-19 and
            vaccines. I also wanted to implement this in a way where the users
            wouldn't feel overwhelmed by information either. My solution to this
            was to create cards, where (hopfully) the user would be drawn to
            hover over and read the information. Another reason that I liked
            that idea is that the user can choose which card to learn about. I
            collected the information on the cards from
            <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal3">UN</a> and
            <a
              href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019"
              >WHO</a
            >. This page is made primarily for children around the age 11-14.

          <h2>Making the Corona-game</h2>
          <p>
            As an educated teacher I am very hesitant when it comes to making a
            game that envolves kids and social media. Even though an idea where
            kids get points for how much they recycle and share it on social
            media seems like a fine idea, there are a few conserns. In such a
            case it is likely that someone from a resourseful family can get
            more help at home than someone from a less resourceful family, and
            thus resulting in more points. This could again lead to a bigger gap
            in the social status of kids. This is the reasoning behind my
            careful approach to creating this game.
          </p>
          <p>
            I came up with the idea while consulting with a teacher at a primary
            school. The goal of this game is to raise awareness about the
            unfairness of how vaccines are distributed around the world. By
            letting players experience the unfairness themselves, it might be
            easier to understand this problem.

          <h2>Engaging society</h2>
          <p>
            As this website is meant to be educating children, it is important
            that the information is layed out in a way that encourages learning.
            It is also important that the information is relevant and filtered
            to fit the set age group. To ensure this I have consulted the
            information I have on this page with three different teachers. One
            working at a primaryschool, one advisor at a junior high school, and
            a teacher of social studies in the set age group.

          <h2>Designing the webpage</h2>
          <p>
            I intended to design a webpage without too many distractions. The
            fonts that I use were chosen to make it easier for users read. To
            help me create a color scheme I used
            <a href="https://coolors.co/">coolers.co</a>. I find this to be a
            nice tool to help me create a color scheme, while still having great
            control over the colors I use. All the pictures (except the NTNU
            logos) are taken from
            <a href="https://pixabay.com">pixaby.com</a> and are free to use,
            with no attribution required. I also had to change the background
            colors of these pictures to fit the cards. The corona-game board is
            self-made, with images of the corona virus and vaccine from pixaby.
