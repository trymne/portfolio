              have created 14 goals. These goals also say something about how we
              can build a better future while still taking care of our planet.
              Ending poverty and hunger, giving everyone good education and
              clean water are some of these goals. We will focus on goal 3: Good
              health and well-being.

              For many people in poor countries it is not possible to see a
              doctor if you are sick, and giving birth can be very dangerous for
              the mother. These are some of the things this goal is made to
              improve.

              The coronavirus (COVID-19) is a virus that has been infecting over
              200 million since the end of 2019.
            </p>
            <p class="cardtext">
              Most people that get infected by this virus only get some mild
              symptoms like fever, cough, tiredness and loss of taste and smell.
              However the virus can still be very dangerous, especially for
              older people.

            <p class="cardtext">
              The vaccines will highly reduce the chanses to get seriously ill
              from the virus. If a big part of a the population are vaccinated
              there will therefore be less pressure on the hospitals.

              Sadly there is a huge difference in how available the vaccines are
              for people in rich and poor countries.

            <p>Here are two things you can do to help!</p>
            <p class="cardtext">
              By protecting yourself you will also protect those around you. If
              you don't get the virus, you can't infect others.
            </p>
            <p class="cardtext">
              One easy step you can do to protect yourself is to clean your
              hands often with soap or hand sanitiser. Another important way you
              can help is by testing yourself for COVID-19 if you get sick.
