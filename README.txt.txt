I decided to have all HTML files and CSS files in the root folder. With only 5 HTML files and 3 CSS files 
it was still easy to organize my files like this. If i were to have more pages i would have organized my pages 
in folders. I decided to keep all my pictures in one folder, and one subfolder. For this web page this was again 
an easy way of organizing it. With more complex sites I would either have the pictures inside the folder of the 
page it belongs to, or in a category based on picture category. 

CHANGES FOR SECOND ATTEMPT

Unnecessary divs: 
I removed some unnecessary divs both in the header, footer and main article. instead of "div.text_box" i 
have just article instead. 

Footer: 
I've made a lot of changes to the footer to make it more reliable. I added more margin, and changed the 
positioning to relative. I also made the phone number clickable. I've also done some more changes to/for the 
footer in the contact page. It wasn't very easy (for me) with a short page with both header, main and footer 
that changes height depending on screen size. I made it work for all screens except galaxy fold (280-653).
I sat the height of that page's body to 100vh, and min height to 600px to make it work better. I also used
absolute positioning for that footer instead on relative. 

BR was removed and "replaced" with css styles.

Why 3 style sheets
First of all i see this assignment as a chance to learn new things. I wanted to see how it would be to have 
one stylesheet for all the standard css rules i would use throughout my whole web page, and for page-specific 
css-rules i would have another stylesheet. The positives would be that its (maybe) easier and faster to work in. 
It is also easy to know, as the maker, if the element im changing is in the general or specific stylesheet.
I found it as a nice way to do it, but i agree that its not necessary for an assignmentthis small. 

I checked with CSS validator and found 0 errors.
