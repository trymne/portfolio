        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <p>
          These projects all have quite different focus as these were all done
          as part of school projects or exams. Therefore, in some projects the
          aim would be on the JavaScript, while other focus on CSS art or
          scrollytelling. Some of the projects are also group projects, and in
          them I will add more detailed information in a readme file to explain
          what I did in the project.

          <h2>CSS Art</h2>
          <p class="cardtext">
            In this project the aim was to recreate an image of a car with CSS.
            This was a project we had early in the 2nd semester as an
            introduction to advanced CSS. This projected is not made to be
            responsive.

          <h2>Exam in webcoding</h2>
          <p class="cardtext">
            This was a part of the exam we had in the subject webcoding. This
            class was our introduction to CSS and HTML, therefore this is also
            what the exam focused on. This was only one part of multiple tasks
            given on the exam.

            This was our final obligatory work in the subject webcoding. Our
            task was to create a webpage to raise awareness towards one of the
            UN ustainable development goals. More information about this project
            can be found under the "about" page in the project.

            This was a big project in the subject advanced CSS. Sadly this page
            isn't fully responsive, so if the screen looks too wide you could
            try to resize the screen.
