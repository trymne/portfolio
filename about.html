        <h2>Preporation and work before the assignment</h2>
        <p>
          I have no experience at all in coding from before i started the
          bachelor this august. I do believe that i have the abilities to become
          a good front (or back) end developer, so i am trying to stay a little
          bit ahead of this course. I also paid for an online
          <a href="https://codewithmosh.com/" class="text_link">course</a>
          thats teaching the basics of html and css, and i have been working
          with that in addition to the labs and pdfs from the lectures. I live
          in Lillehammer, so therefore I often work with css and html from home
          yet i always go trough the pdfs.

        <h2>Making the web page</h2>
        <p>
          I wanted to create the web page with a simple and clear structure. I
          also wanted to try and ake the web page responsive, this turned out to
          be very challenging (and educational). I've uses some different
          semantic tags. For the main structure i have "header", "main" and
          "footer", I have also used article. I used div for making buttons, as
          text boxes and for making the header and footerI've used links with 3
          different hover properties, and made an attempt at creating a sound
          hierarchy for my H1, H2, H3. To help my web page get responsive i
          created some rules for screens smaller than 624px, and 400px. I chose
          these values because this was when the boxes and heading started
          getting cramped.
